My solutions to leet code problems

Two Sum Problem: In two-sum.py, I was to be given an array of integers nums and an integer target, and then return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
I may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and I may not use the same element twice.
I can return the answer in any order.

Add 2 Numbers Problem: In add2nums.py, I was to be given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, 
and each of their nodes contains a single digit. I have to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
I may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
